      <h2>What is CSS?</h2>

      <p><strong>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</strong> is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and
        styling of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).
        CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.</p>

      <p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.
        This separation can improve content accessibility;[further explanation needed] provide more flexibility and control
        in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying
        the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the.
        css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.</p>

      <p>The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type) text/css
        is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents.</p>

      <h2>What is Javascript?</h2>

      
      <p><strong>JavaScript</strong> often abbreviated as <b>JS</b>, is a programming language and core technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.
        99% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries.
        All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.</p>
      
    
        <p><strong>JavaScript</strong> is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation,
        and first-class functions. It is multiparadigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with
        text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM). is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.

        <p>The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.</p>
      
      
        <p>JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some servers and a variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.</p>
      
      <p>
        Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.

      <h2>What is a Web Framework?</h2>

      <p>
        A web framework is a software framework designed to support the development of web applications, including web services, web resources, and web APIs. It provides tools, libraries,
        and pre-built components to simplify the process of building and deploying web applications.
        Key Features of Web Frameworks:

      <h2>Key Features of Web Frameworks:</h2>

      <ol>

        <li>Code Reusability: Offers reusable code modules and templates to save development time.</li>
        <li>Routing: Handles URL mapping to specific parts of your application.</li>
        <li>Middleware Support: Allows for processing requests and responses (e.g., authentication, logging)</li>
        <li>Templating: Helps in generating dynamic HTML content.</li>
        <li>Database Integration: Simplifies database operations like CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)</li>
        <li>Security: Provides built-in protection against common vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting).</li>
        <li>Scalability: Makes it easier to scale your application as needed.</li>
